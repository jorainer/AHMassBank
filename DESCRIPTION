Description:
    Supplies AnnotationHub with MassBank metabolite/compound annotations
    bundled in CompDb SQLite databases. CompDb SQLite databases contain general
    compound annotation as well as fragment spectra representing fragmentation
    patterns of compounds' ions. MassBank data is retrieved from
    https://massbank.eu/MassBank and processed using helper functions from the
    CompoundDb Bioconductor package into redistributable SQLite databases.
